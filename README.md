## About
MySafeChain allows product manufacturers (medical products and other valued/important products) to generate and certify on the blockchain the unique codes of all items produced. Consumers can be able to verify the authenticity of the items purchased using the app. All this information is recorded, tracked, and verified using smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain.

So in the example below, the reason one tag is bad is that the code is not in our smart contract yet.

###### Product codes are recorded through a specialized backoffice dashboard built for product producers and factories.
###### They are able to record serail numbers of products into our backend infrastructure.

## Technoloy
Our smart contract is written and deployed on the Tezos Blockchain using the SmartPy Library.
Endusers only need a mobile app to verify the existence of products stored on our smart contract.
This is all coded on the blockchain to ensure immutability and data replication.

As a working prototype in actual real world use, the app can already be used in verification by end users.

Here are some examples to try out. Scan these with the app.
